# Agent2Agent (A2A) Demo with LLM Function Calling

This repository demonstrates how to connect multiple AI agents using the `Agent2Agent` (A2A) protocol an open standard developed by `Google` and donated to the `Linux Foundation`. A2A enables framework and language agnostic communication and collaboration between agents.

In this demo, a `Host Agent` classifies user input, makes a routing decision, and forwards the request to the appropriate agent via A2A clients using `LLM function calling`.

## Architecture / Flow

1. **User Input** is received from the terminal.
2. The **Host Agent (LLM-powered)**:
   * Classifies the request.
   * Decides the routing.
   * Uses **function calling** to forward the request to the relevant agent.

3. The **A2A Clients** handle communication between the Host Agent and other agents(_e.g., localhost:10001, localhost:10002_) using the **A2A protocol**.

4. **Agents** process the request:
   * **Market Price Agent** â†’ provides the price information of the requested currency, metal, or stock
   * **Investment Advisor Agent** â†’ provides investment-related advice in the requested area
